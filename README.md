### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had difficulty with formatting, but I was able to seek help from the slack community on the problem. Additionally, I had a bit of a problem with the photos cutting off due to different phone sizes, but I utilized the knowledge I have accumulated thus far to fix that bug.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I feel like I came across a lot of small techincal issues throughout the assignment, but I debugged them with the help of the tutors and google. It was definitely an educational experience.
